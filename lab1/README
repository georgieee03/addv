There are two folders in the project:
  - async_fifo for part 1
  - even_odd_ac for part 2

Both folders have Makefiles, simply running `make` will run everything end 2 end. This includes:
  1. Compiling the system verilog
  2. Simulating the testbench
  3. Synthesizing the desing (available for both designs)
  4. Launching Verdi

The targets in both Makefiles are as follows:
  - all : for running everything
  - compile : for running VCS
  - sim : for running the simv executable
  - verdi : for launching Verdi
  - synth : for running DC compiler
  - clean_synth : for cleaning the synthesis files
  - clean : for cleaning everything (including synthesis)
